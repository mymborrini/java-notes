/**
 * GARBAGE COLLECTOR
 * 
 * What is Garbage Collector and what are its advantages?
 *  . Garbage collection in java is an automatic process of looking at heap memory, identifying which objects are in use and which are not, and deleting the unused objects.
 *  . An in use object, or a referenced object, means that some part of your program still maintains a pointer to that object
 *  . An unused object or unreferenced object is no longer referenced by any part of your program. So the memory used by an unreferenced object can be reclaimed.
 *  . Main Advantage of automatic garbage collection in java is that it removes the burden of manual memory allocation/deallocation from us that we can focus on problem solving.
 * 
 * Where are objects created in memory? On stack or heap
 *  . Whenever an object is created, it's always stored in the Heap space and stack memory contains the reference to it. Stack memory only contains local primitive variables and reference variables
 * to objects in heap space.
